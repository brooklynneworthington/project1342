        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Fælledparken</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">On the park’s halfpipe, Copenhagen skateboarding icon and Monster Energy rider Rune Glifberg set the tone for an epic weekend with his signature blend of stylish and technical vert skating. Highlights of the free-flowing session included head-high frontside nosebone, ollie frontside Smith grind over the channel, heelflip indy, and gay twist heelflip Indy.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Fælledparken</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Next up, Glifberg’s Monster Energy teammate Gabriel Fortunato stoked the crowd in the Best Foot Forward Am Contest on the Fælledparken concrete street park. Hailing from the streets of Suzano in Brazil, Fortunato covered the course with technical tricks like Half Cab 50-50 the rail, big flip up the Euro gap, nollie backside kickflip and alley-oop 360 ollie over the hip, backside noseblunt the wallride, as well as 360 kickflip and ollie late body varial over the centerpiece pyramid for a strong third place finish.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">A Best Trick Session</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">As the sun set over Fælledparken, the organizers installed a flaming, seven-foot ring of fire on the pyramid platform for the day’s highlight: A Best Trick Session through the flames. Threading the needle with a stunt through a loop like this sure is a feat in itself – but setting it on fire definitely ups the ante. Keeping his cool, Monster Energy’s Wair sent a lofty backside kickflip through the Ring of Fire for the win!</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Cash For Tricks Session</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Day Two continued the fun vibes with a cash-for-tricks session in the middle of the city. The mission: send your best moves over a kicker obstacle featuring an oversized pair of CPH Open sunglasses on its platform. Again, Fortunato dug into his bag of tech moves with an ollie frontside late shove-it, heelflip and huge 360 kickflip. Wair was also stacking bundles in the cash-for-tricks event with highlights including switch frontside kickflip and switch kickflip over the kicker.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Street Spots</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">At each of the street spots around the skate-friendly Scandinavian city, the action drew hundreds of spectators in a festival atmosphere. Energy levels were high as the crowds, many wearing CPH Open’s heart-shaped sunglasses, spontaneously celebrated every trick – exactly what makes CPH Open a one-of-a-kind happening in the skateboarding universe.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Ledges By the Pier</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Day 3 saw the crew board a train to join a miniramp session at a trainyard outside the city. This was followed by a heavy Best Trick session on the ledges by the pier. Although the session was cut short by a sudden rainstorm, spirits remained high as the good vibes continued.</p>
